description: Park a passing thought as a later-task without derailing the current one — logged, not acted on.
argument-hint: [thought to park — optional]
---

Park this thought — **$ARGUMENTS** — as a sidenote. A sidenote is a *later-task*, not a *now-task*. Your job is to record it and keep going, nothing more.

**The contract — hold it exactly:**

- **Do not act on it.** Don't investigate it, don't open the files it mentions, don't add it to your current plan, don't answer the question it poses. It is parked, not pending.
- **Do not let it touch the current task.** Its scope, plan, priorities, and *pace* stay exactly as they were. In particular: **do not speed up or cut corners to "get to" the note.** The whole point of parking it is that it costs the current work nothing.
- **Urgency doesn't override the contract.** If the note reads as urgent ("prod is down", "this is broken"), that's the wrong channel — a real emergency is a normal interruption, not a sidenote. Still just log it and resume; the human will escalate directly if they meant to.

**Persist it so it survives this session** (context gets compacted; memory doesn't count as "logged"):

1. Append one entry to `.claude/sidenotes.md` at the project root — create the file (and `.claude/`) if missing.
2. Format — an open checkbox, the verbatim thought, then a one-line **anchor** so the note still makes sense when another session or agent reads it cold (the verbatim thought alone is full of "this / here / it" that dangles without the moment that produced it):

   ```
   - [ ] [<today's date, YYYY-MM-DD>] <the thought, captured verbatim>
     ↳ <task you were mid-way through> · <file/area the note points at, if "this"/"here" resolves to one> · <branch>@<short-sha>
   ```

   - **Thought — verbatim.** Don't paraphrase or "improve" it; capture what was said.
   - **Anchor — coordinates you already hold, not a research task.** Fill it only from what's already in front of you: the task in progress, the file/area currently in focus, the current branch and short SHA (already in your session's git context). **Do not open files, grep, or investigate the note's subject to complete it** — that would break the park contract. Any field you don't already know, omit. The anchor records where you were standing; it never sends you looking.

Then: **one-line acknowledgement** (e.g. `Parked in .claude/sidenotes.md — continuing.`) and **resume exactly where you left off**, as if the note had never arrived.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty** (a bare `/sidenote`), there's nothing to park — treat it as a *flush*: read `.claude/sidenotes.md` and list the **open** entries back to me so I can decide what to pick up. Open means *not checked off* — every entry except the ones marked done (`- [x]`), so older bullets without a checkbox still count. Change nothing, act on nothing, then resume. (Checking an item off to `- [x]` happens when it's actually handled — not part of parking or flushing.)
